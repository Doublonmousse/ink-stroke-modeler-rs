- [ ] tests for the stroke modeler
    - We don't append to a vec passed in arguments (`UpdateAppendsToResults`)
    - `RejectInputIfNegativeTimeDelta` and `RejectDuplicateInput` are not implemented here and are cases that are caught in the rnote code ...
    - `FarApartTimesDoNotCrashForUp` and `FarApartTimesDoNotCrashForMove` : the rnote code already prevents this happening
    - Same for `IgnoreTDownWhileStrokeIsInProgress`
- [ ] check if `n_steps` robustness should be changed to pass all the tests in `position_modeler_test.cc`
     - some of these things are things done in the rnote code instead so that error wouldn't happen here
- [ ] use more `reserve`s on vec like the C++ code to speed up vec allocations
- [ ] review the code one more time
- [ ] performance and less `Copy` traits (copy less data around)
- [ ] adapt the default settings (cm for distance and seconds for time != what's rnote reporting)
- [ ] docstrings updates
- [ ] API changes (f32 vs f64, and using rust durations) ?
